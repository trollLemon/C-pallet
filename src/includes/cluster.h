/*  Cluster.h
 *  Header file for a Cluster Class.
 *  A Cluster contains a list of points, one of them being the centroid.
 *  The centroid is the average value of all the other points within the
 * cluster. A cluster is also assigned a unique ID.
 *
 *  This implementation provides client code the ability to add points to a
 * cluster, get the clusters id, get the hex value of the centroids color, and
 * recalculate a new centroid.
